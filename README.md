# Task created for DataNinja hiring process

This project has been created with create-react-app
It's using Material-UI for table component and for jss styles
React Context is used for global state management (for grid state fetch, by dispatching getGridData() action)

## Live demo:

[dataninja.bostic.ge](https://dataninja.bostic.ge/)

## To run the project locally, after cloning in editor, run:

### `yarn`
### `yarn start`


## My new experience from this project:

### I learned a lot about React Context
### Used context for global state management, instead of Redux (Took me most of the time)
### Used jss, instead of css or styled components
